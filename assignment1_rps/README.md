## Overview

This project is my solution for Assignment 1, based on Dr. Logeeshan’s instructions and the official Jac documentation.  
It demonstrates:
- **Scale-agnostic Jac code:** The same game runs locally or can be served as a cloud API using `jac serve`.
- **AI-enhanced Jac code:** Jac's LLM (`byLLM`) integration delivers context-aware, fun banter in game rounds.

Inspired by the number guessing game example, I implemented a unique **Rock, Paper, Scissors** variant.
